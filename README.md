### 📊 Bank Marketing Decision Tree Classifier

This project builds a **Decision Tree Classifier** to predict whether a customer will subscribe to a term deposit based on demographic and behavioral data. The model is trained and evaluated using the **Bank Marketing dataset** from the UCI Machine Learning Repository.

#### 🔍 Dataset Summary

The dataset includes client information such as:

* **Demographics**: Age, job, marital status, education
* **Financial status**: Default, housing loan, personal loan
* **Campaign details**: Contact method, day, month, duration, number of contacts
* **Previous marketing outcomes**
* **Target variable**: Whether the client subscribed to a term deposit (`yes`/`no`)

#### ⚙️ Project Features

* Data loading and preprocessing
* Categorical encoding
* Train/test split
* Decision Tree model training
* Accuracy and classification report
* Tree visualization for interpretability

#### 📌 Objective

To use machine learning (specifically, Decision Trees) to assist in predicting potential customers for future marketing campaigns, improving efficiency and targeting.
